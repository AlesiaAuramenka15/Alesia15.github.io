                    Endless legends surround the mystery of "La Joconde ".
                    Art historians, journalists and enthusiasts have been 
                    arguing for decades about what Mona Lisa's smile means,
                    is it not a fake that hangs in the Louvre
                    and who is depicted in the Leonardo’s masterpiece?
                    How did it happen that it was “Gioconda” 
                    who won the “world championship” among all the works 
                    and “art” selfies?

                    Try to do the impossible and forget that “Gioconda”
                    is a picture of pictures. What do you see in front of you?
                    A small-sized portrait of a not very beautiful and 
                    modestly dressed woman. Why did she press 
                    such strong rivals like Nefertiti, Raphael's Sistine Madonna,
                    or Venus in front of a mirror by Velasquez on the podium of honor?
                    To answer this question, it is not enough to know 
                    the milestones of the Mona Lisa's victorious path to world fame.
                    It is much more important to understand not “how it was,” 
                    but “why it happened.” That is to understand this mechanism.

                    Most people are sure that the portrait of Leonardo is Mona Lisa,
                    wife of Francesco del Giocondo.Hence the second name of 
                    the painting - “Gioconda”. The real Mona Lisa got married 
                    at sixteen for a widower who is much older than her, 
                    who had buried two wives by that time. 
                    She lived the mundane of a noblewoman married just for money

                        Another contribution to the romantic aura that surrounds “Gioconda” is
                        a play about a  touching love story that happened  between 
                        the genius Leonardo and his model. Its author is 
                        the great visionary Jules Verne.In his early play "The Mona Lisa" 
                        he portrayed her as a  mistress of the great Florentine.
                        Thus, in the minds of reading Europe, a love triangle arose-
                        a young handsome artist, an old merchant husband,
                        and a beautiful Gioconda. And no one cared 
                        that in reality Mona Lisa’s husband was much younger 
                        than Leonardo, and the artist himself was persecuted for homosexuality.

                    discussed that it feels that another riddle is completely ruled out.
                   In order to do that masterpiece justice justice, 
                    another question that has long fascinated art experts will be mentioned:
                    what happened to Mona Lisa's eyebrows?
                    "If you look closely at Mona Lisa's eye
                     you can clearly see that the cracks around
                    the eye have slightly disappeared,
                    and that may be explained that one day
                     a curator or restorer cleaned the eye,
                     and cleaning the eye removed, probably 
                    removed the eyelashes and eyebrow,"

                who decided to write a copy of Mona Lisa. To his surprise, 
                where the painting usually hung, there was a gaping void.
                “Probably visiting the photographers from the weekend, 
                they will bring back soon,” his servants reassured.

                had stolen two ancient stone figurines from the heart of the world of the antiques.
                Picasso considered primitive artists to be the forerunners of the Cubists.
                He always wanted to have their works besides him all the time.
                Museums, he considered the tombs of art, where it is hidden from real life.
                he police decided that, having stolen the figurines, the avant-gardists 
                got a taste and decided to get their hands on Leonardo's masterpiece.

                gang of avant-garde thieves, they carried out an investigation.

                  the world's first system for identifying criminals

                    that his goal was to return to Italy a masterpiece, stolen by Napoleon.
                    Leonard simply did not know that France had bought the painting
                    three hundred years before Napoleon came to power. After some time,
                    he brought a picture from Paris to Florence in a road box with a double bottom.
                    There, littered with dirty shirts and socks, It was revieled to the police,
                     after he was reported, which led to the end of the mystery.
                    
                    Leonard was arrested. What he said during interrogations caused

                    the picture turned out to be the heroine of a world sensation.
